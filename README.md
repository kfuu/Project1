# Project1

To run the code for this project:

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Currently the `intermediatefile.txt` (in `Intermediate_files` folder) and `outfile.txt` (in `Output_files` folder) have data/text in them for the purpose of showing the results of the test. However, when you run the code on a new text file, be sure to clear out the contents of the text files, just in case.
3. When you load in your own input text file, be sure to change to name it `infile.txt`. Name the existing file to a different name, such as `infile-old.txt` to avoid conflicts.
4. There is no need to type in the directories for the command line arguments as they have already been set up in Properties settings of the project inside Visual Studio. Therefore, when you run it, simply open up the project in Visual Studio and click the green triangle to run.
5. When running, you will see a message on the black terminal window indicating the program is running. When the program is finished, a `SUCCESS.txt` file will be created in the `Output_files` folder, the sorted and aggregated results from the Reduce class will be in the `outfile.txt` file, and the intermediary data will be in the `intermediatefile.txt` file.
